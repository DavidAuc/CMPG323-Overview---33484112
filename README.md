## Branching strategy:
All projects will make use of the GitHub flow branching strategy:
Developers start with the main branch, then separate their work into feature branches that come directly from the master, which are subsequently merged back into the main branch. After that, the feature branch is removed.

The basic concept behind this strategy is to maintain the master code in a deployable state at all times, supporting methods for continuous integration and continuous delivery.

## .gitignore file uses
The .gitignore file will be used to exclude some unnecessary files and data, the gitignore ensures that these data are not tracked and committed to git.
Each project may have the following types of files added to the .gitignore:
Operating system files
Application files
Language and framework files
Files downloaded with package managers
Credentials

## Credentials and sensitive information storage
Every project will make use of the .gitignore file to keep credentials and information safe.
